CRITIQUE OF PURE REASON,60,title,"The Critique of Pure Reason is arranged around several basic distinctions. After the two Prefaces (the A edition Preface of 1781 and the B edition Preface of 1787) and the Introduction, the book is divided into the Doctrine of Elements and the Doctrine of Method."
Doctrine of Elements,40,doctrine,"The Doctrine of Elements sets out the a priori products of the mind, and the correct and incorrect use of these presentations. Kant further divides the Doctrine of Elements into the Transcendental Aesthetic and the Transcendental Logic, reflecting his basic distinction between sensibility and the understanding. In the ""Transcendental Aesthetic"" he argues that space and time are pure forms of intuition inherent in our faculty of sense. The ""Transcendental Logic"" is separated into the Transcendental Analytic and the Transcendental Dialectic:"
Doctrine of Methods,40,doctrine,"The Doctrine of Method contains four sections. The first section, ""Discipline of Pure Reason"", compares mathematical and logical methods of proof, and the second section, ""Canon of Pure Reason"", distinguishes theoretical from practical reason."
Trascendental Analytic,20,division,"The Transcendental Analytic sets forth the appropriate uses of a priori concepts, called the categories, and other principles of the understanding, as conditions of the possibility of a science of metaphysics. The section titled the ""Metaphysical Deduction"" considers the origin of the categories. In the ""Transcendental Deduction"", Kant then shows the application of the categories to experience. Next, the ""Analytic of Principles"" sets out arguments for the relation of the categories to metaphysical principles. This section begins with the ""Schematism"", which describes how the imagination can apply pure concepts to the object given in sense perception. Next are arguments relating the a priori principles with the schematized categories."
Trascendental Dialectic,20,division,"The Transcendental Dialectic describes the transcendental illusion behind the misuse of these principles in attempts to apply them to realms beyond sense experience. Kant’s most significant arguments are the ""Paralogisms of Pure Reason"", the ""Antinomy of Pure Reason"", and the ""Ideal of Pure Reason"", aimed against, respectively, traditional theories of the soul, the universe as a whole, and the existence of God. In the Appendix to the ""Critique of Speculative Theology"" Kant describes the role of the transcendental ideas of reason."
Trascendental Aesthetic,20,part,"The Transcendental Aesthetic, as the Critique notes, deals with ""all principles of a priori sensibility."
